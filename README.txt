CS 2261 Final Project M02 README
Rags to Riches

------------------------------------------------------------
Preface
------------------------------------------------------------
I did not implement the ability to buy items yet, 
even though that was part of my suggested implementations
for M02. This is because I'm still not sure exactly how
I would want that aspect to be done, especially since I want
there to be multiple levels in some way. I want to explore
how buying items will be implemented over the course of just
developing the game itself, so that it feels more natural as
opposed to forcing an implementation so that I can just
get a perfect score. I value the freedom and exploration
that comes with building this final project in my personal
image more than I value a slightly higher grade, even if 
that means that  I have more to develop for the next 
milestone. When I feel like the next move is item selection 
and buying, I will look more into developing that feature.

Game Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------

Game opens to a title screen splash art for the Game
DISCLAIMER: Title screen is completely stolen from a 
commercially released game. Will change in the next 
iteration, it's just there as placeholder.

Pressing START will begin the game. Move the character 
using the arrow keys.

You can go up to the counters and press A to place an 
item in a spot. Once you select an item, then you can 
change the price it will be up for. Once you have the 
correct price, press A to place it.

If an item is placed on the counter, then you can go up to
it and press B to change the price for it. Press A to 
confirm the new price and continue on with the game.

Placing an item on the rightmost area of the counter
with a price of 35 will trigger the win state.

------------------------------------------------------------
Looking forward
------------------------------------------------------------
The lose state will result from going into debt at the
end of 3 levels of the game.

the win state will result from making a profit at the
end of 3 levels of the game.
